# Write-up Template

### Analyze, choose, and justify the appropriate resource option for deploying the app.

For this project, I had to choose between using a Virtual Machine (VM) or an App Service (Web App) to deploy my CMS application. I chose App Service because it’s a fully managed platform, which means I don’t have to handle the infrastructure myself. It also includes features like automatic scaling, built-in monitoring, and easy deployment options. As someone who is still learning, this made the whole process super simple.

### Assess app changes that would change your decision.

*Detail how the app and any other needs would have to change for you to change your decision in the last section.* 
If I had chosen a Virtual Machine, I would need to set up the server myself (install Python, Flask, Git, etc.), manually configure the web server, and handle updates, patches, and scaling on my own.
This would give me more control, but it would also be more complex and time-consuming — especially for a small project like this.
